 * Run a sequence of configured validation commands and return ValidationEntry results.

 * Semantics:
 * - Empty commands array → returns a single 'skipped' entry with status 'skipped'.
 * - Commands run sequentially; stops at first failure.
 * - Success is determined by exit code membership in successExitCodes (default [0]).
 * - Never throws on command failure — failure is represented as ValidationEntry with status 'fail'.
 *
 * SEC-004 — Trust boundary:
 * Validation commands are user-defined strings from the project config file, which is
 * an operator-controlled file (not untrusted external data). These commands are run
 * via `runner.run(cmd.command)` — which uses `shell: true` in LocalExecutor.
 * This is intentional: operators author these commands exactly as they would write
 * them in a shell script. The trust boundary is: validation command strings MUST NOT
 * include external (scanner-sourced or network-sourced) data. Package names, versions,
 * and any variable data from external sources must never be interpolated into
 * validationCommands. Callers are responsible for this invariant.
