# lint-docs.sh — mechanically validate the Living Docs invariants on a docs bundle.
#
# The five invariants are a contract. Three of them are mechanical and should be
# checked by a machine, not by an agent re-reading prose ("a constraint without an
# instrument is a vibe"). This script is that instrument. It checks:
#
#   - Indexed or it doesn't exist (invariant 3): every concept file is listed in its
#     directory's index.md, and every directory index is reachable from the bundle root.
#   - Links resolve (invariants 2/3): every bundle-relative / relative link to a local
#     file points at a file that exists.
#   - Supersede, never rewrite (invariant 4): a Superseded record carries superseded_by,
#     and the target exists.
#   - OKF format: every non-reserved doc opens with frontmatter carrying a non-empty
#     `type`; index.md/log.md carry no frontmatter (except the bundle-root index.md,
#     which may declare okf_version).
#   - Visibility (optional): absent ⇒ private (default-deny); if present it must be
#     one of private|public|showcase. The visibility *value* is mechanical; deciding
#     which docs are public is authoring judgment (the living-docs skill), not lint.
#
# Invariants 1 (docs-first mirror) and 2's "one home per fact" semantic half are NOT
# mechanical — they stay with the reviewing agent. This script never claims to check them.
#
# Usage:  lint-docs.sh [BUNDLE_ROOT]      (default: docs)
#         lint-docs.sh --ratchet <baseline-ref> [BUNDLE_ROOT]
#         lint-docs.sh --help
#
# Default (whole-bundle) mode:
#   Exit 0 = clean, 1 = ANY violation, 2 = usage / bundle-not-found error.
#
# --ratchet <baseline-ref> mode (diff-aware):
#   Lint the current bundle AND the bundle as of <baseline-ref> (a git ref), then
#   exit 1 ONLY for violations present now that were ABSENT at baseline (NEW debt
#   introduced by the change). Pre-existing violations are printed as informational
#   "(pre-existing)" lines and do NOT fail the run — legacy debt is not held against
#   the change. This mirrors the diff-aware ratchet the repo's other gates use:
#   only NEW violations block; pre-existing debt is grandfathered.
#
#   These checks are whole-bundle (index reachability, orphan membership, link
#   resolution, supersede integrity) — they are NOT file-local, so "lint only the
#   touched files" cannot work. The ratchet therefore compares violation SETS, not
#   files. The baseline bundle is materialized with `git worktree add` (robust for
#   a whole directory) and removed afterward. Baseline ref absent / not a git repo /
#   bundle missing at baseline → the baseline set is treated as EMPTY, so every
#   current violation is considered NEW (fail-closed, documented in --help).

$PROG — validate the mechanical Living Docs invariants on a docs bundle.

Usage:
  $PROG [BUNDLE_ROOT]               Lint the bundle (default: ./docs)
  $PROG --ratchet <ref> [BUNDLE]    Diff-aware: fail only on NEW violations vs <ref>
  $PROG --help                      Show this help

Checks (mechanical invariants only):
  * frontmatter      every non-reserved .md opens with frontmatter + non-empty type
  * index format     index.md / log.md carry no frontmatter (bundle-root index.md
                     may declare okf_version)
  * directory index  every concept file is listed in its own directory's index.md
  * reachable        every directory index.md is reachable from the bundle-root index.md
  * links resolve    every local (/… or relative) markdown link points at a file
  * supersede        a 'status: Superseded' record carries a resolvable superseded_by
  * visibility       optional; absent ⇒ private; if present must be private|public|showcase

Diff-aware ratchet (--ratchet <baseline-ref>):
  Lints the current bundle and the bundle as of <baseline-ref> (a git ref), and
  fails (exit 1) ONLY for violations present now that were absent at the baseline —
  i.e. NEW debt introduced by the change. Pre-existing violations are printed as
  "(pre-existing)" and do NOT fail the run; a change that adds no new violation
  passes even if the bundle carries legacy debt. The baseline is materialized with
  'git worktree add'. If <baseline-ref> is absent, the tree is not a git repo, or
  the bundle does not exist at the baseline, the baseline is treated as empty
  (every current violation counts as NEW — fail-closed).

  These checks are whole-bundle, not file-local, so the ratchet compares violation
  SETS rather than touched files. One CLI enforced at the git boundary (pre-commit)
  and in CI (a reusable Action) is harness-agnostic: it covers every AI harness AND
  human commits with one mechanism, instead of a per-harness plugin.

Exit: 0 clean (or no new violations) · 1 violations (or new violations) · 2 usage error.
