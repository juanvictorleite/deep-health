# CLI Reference — security-scan

## Overview

```
security-scan <command> [options]
```

All commands require Docker and Node.js ≥ 26. Use `nvm use` to activate the correct version (the project includes `.nvmrc`). See [ADR-0001](./adr/0001-docker-only-runtime.md) for why Docker is required — no local mode is supported for ecosystem CLIs.

---

## Commands

### `init`

Generates a `project-config.yml` starter template in the current directory.

```bash
security-scan init [options]

Options:
  --project-name <name>   Project name written into config
  --client <name>         Client name written into config
  --output <path>         Output path (default: ./project-config.yml)
  --force                 Overwrite if the file already exists
```

**What it does:**

1. Detects the runtime environment (PHP version from `composer.json`, Node version from `.nvmrc` / `package.json`, Python version from `runtime.txt` / `.python-version`).
2. Renders a `project-config.yml` from the built-in Handlebars template (`infrastructure/config/templates/project-config.hbs.ts`).
3. Writes to the output path. Fails if the file exists and `--force` is not set.

**Exit codes:** `0` success, `3` config/output error.

---

### `scan`

Runs the vulnerability scan only. No files are modified.

```bash
security-scan scan [options]

Options:
  -c, --config <path>   Path to project-config.yml (default: ./project-config.yml)
  --cwd <path>          Working directory (default: current directory)
  --dry-run             Print what would run, execute nothing
  -v, --verbose         Enable verbose output
  -q, --quiet           Suppress all output except errors and final report
  --json                Output results as JSON to stdout
  -o, --output <path>   Write output to file instead of stdout
```

**What it does:**

1. Loads `project-config.yml` and validates with Zod schema.
2. Calls `runScanner()` which runs `osv-scanner` in an ephemeral Docker container against detected lockfiles.
3. Formats and emits the result (text summary or JSON).

**Exit codes:**

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `0` | No vulnerabilities found |
| `1` | Breaking vulnerabilities found |
| `2` | Scanner error (gate failure or OSV error) |
| `3` | Configuration error |

---

### `fix`

Full workflow: scan → apply safe updates per ecosystem → generate executive report.

```bash
security-scan fix [options]

Options:
  -c, --config <path>             Path to project-config.yml
  --phases <phases>               Comma-separated phases to run.
                                  Accepted values: scan, npm, composer, pip, report
                                  Default: all phases
  --no-report                     Skip executive report generation
  --authorize-breaking <id...>    Allow breaking-change updates for these ecosystems.
                                  Repeatable: --authorize-breaking npm --authorize-breaking composer
  --dry-run                       Log planned changes, execute nothing
  -v, --verbose                   Enable verbose output
  --json                          Output results as JSON
  -o, --output <path>             Write report to file
```

**What it does:**

See the [Orchestrator Pipeline Flow](./architecture.md#orchestrator-pipeline-flow) diagram. In short:

1. Loads config and validates.
2. Runs all scanner engines (OSV primary + SonarQube secondary if configured).
3. Runs Gate A validation on the OSV result.
4. For each registered ecosystem plugin (in registration order):
   a. Runs advisors (informational only — never blocks).
   b. Skips the plugin if there are no `auto_safe` vulnerabilities (or no `breaking` vulns when `--authorize-breaking` was given).
   c. Resolves the Docker container runner (npm/pip/composer).
   d. For npm, auto-demotes `osv`/`osv-then-audit` to `npm-audit` if `package-lock.json` has `lockfileVersion: 1` (osv-scanner cannot patch v1 lockfiles in-place). Applies OSV staging-fix if the effective strategy is `osv` or `osv-then-audit`.
   e. Calls `plugin.runUpdater()`.
   f. Optionally installs breaking packages (`--authorize-breaking`).
   g. Runs post-update OSV residual verification.
   h. Validates update result against ecosystem gate (Zod schema).
5. Generates and saves the executive report (HTML + optionally Markdown).
6. Writes `.security-scan-audit.json` audit trail.

**Environment variable kill-switch:**

```bash
SECURITY_SCAN_NO_AUTO_FIX=1 security-scan fix
```

Skips all automated fixes after the scan phase. Useful in CI pipelines where you want the scan result without any file mutations.

**Breaking-change authorization:**

```bash
security-scan fix --authorize-breaking composer npm
```

Breaking packages (`classification: 'breaking'`) are skipped unless their ecosystem is explicitly authorized. Authorization is per-run and never persisted.

**Exit codes:**

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `0` | All resolved (or nothing to fix) |
| `1` | Vulnerabilities found / update errors / pending vulns remain |
| `2` | Gate validation failure or scanner error |
| `3` | Configuration error |

---

### `executive-report`

Generates an executive HTML report from the last scan results stored on disk.

```bash
security-scan executive-report [options]

Options:
  --client <name>     Client name (overrides project-config.yml)
  --project <name>    Project name (overrides project-config.yml)
  -o, --output <path> Write report to file
```

**What it does:**

Reads the most recent scan JSON outputs from the reports directory and renders the executive HTML template via Handlebars. Supports `en` and `pt-br` locales (set via `report_language` in config).

---

### `cloud-setup`

Interactive Google Drive folder picker. Saves the chosen folder ID to `project-config.yml`.

```bash
security-scan cloud-setup
```

**What it does:**

1. Initiates Google OAuth flow (opens browser via `execFile` with `shell: false` — no shell injection possible).
2. Lists your Google Drive folders interactively.
3. Writes the selected folder ID to `cloud_storage.google_drive.folder_id` in `project-config.yml`.

Once configured, `security-scan fix` automatically uploads the executive report to that Drive folder after each run.

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `0` | Clean — no vulnerabilities or all resolved |
| `1` | Vulnerabilities found, update errors, or pending vulns after fix |
| `2` | Gate validation failure or scanner error |
| `3` | Configuration error |

These codes make `security-scan` suitable for CI/CD pipelines. A non-zero exit from `scan` or `fix` will fail the pipeline step.
