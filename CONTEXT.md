# CONTEXT

Domain vocabulary for `osv-security-cli` (security-scan). Terms here should be used consistently across code, comments, commits, PRs, and architectural discussion.

When a new domain concept stabilizes during design work, add it here. When a term gets sharpened, update the entry rather than creating synonyms.

## Pipeline

**Orchestrator** — `runOrchestrator()` in `src/orchestration/orchestrator.ts`. Owns the full `fix` pipeline: scan → Gate A → per-ecosystem fix → Ecosystem Gate → result aggregation. After Candidate 2's deepening, the per-ecosystem body is delegated to `runEcosystemFix`; the orchestrator only filters phases, runs advisors, dispatches, and aggregates.

**Per-Ecosystem Fix Flow** — `runEcosystemFix()` in `src/orchestration/run-ecosystem-fix.ts`. Encapsulates the per-plugin sub-pipeline: has-updates gate → effective runner resolution → OSV staging-fix → updater → breaking-install → OSV residual verification → ecosystem gate. Returns a tagged outcome (`skipped` / `success` / `error`) for the orchestrator to aggregate. Throws `GateValidationError` when the ecosystem gate rejects.

**Phase** — one of: `scan`, an ecosystem id (`npm`, `pip`, `composer`), or `report`. The `--phases` CLI flag selects a subset.

**Gate A** — Zod-validated schema check on the primary engine's `ScanResultJson`. Failure is fatal.

**Ecosystem Gate** — Zod-validated schema check on a per-ecosystem `UpdateResultJson`. Failure is fatal for that ecosystem.

## Ecosystem

**Ecosystem** — a package manager universe: `npm`, `pip`, `composer`. Identified by a canonical id used in the registry, config, and reports.

**Ecosystem Plugin** — implementation of the `EcosystemPlugin` interface (`src/modules/ecosystem/types.ts`), one per supported ecosystem. Carries metadata (lockfiles, OSV ecosystems, label, supported fixers) and behavior (`runUpdater`, `installBreakingPackages`, `inferVersion`).

**Fixer Strategy** — how vulnerabilities are remediated for an ecosystem: `osv`, `npm-audit`, `osv-then-audit`, `composer-update`. Selected via `ecosystems[].fixer` in config or the plugin's first supported fixer as default. For npm, if the configured strategy is `osv` or `osv-then-audit` and `package-lock.json` has `lockfileVersion: 1` (npm 6 / Node ≤12), `runEcosystemFix` auto-demotes to `npm-audit` at runtime (osv-scanner cannot patch v1 lockfiles in-place).

**OsvFixOutcome** — `{ applied: boolean; packagesUpdated: Array<{ name, versionFrom, versionTo }> }`. Evidence produced by the orchestrator's OSV staging-apply phase and passed into `FixerCallOptions.osvFixOutcome`. Single source of truth in `src/modules/ecosystem/fixers/index.ts`. Consumed by `osv-fixer` (returns package list directly) and `osv-then-audit-fixer` (merges with audit-verified list using last-writer-wins, audit overwrites OSV for the same package name). `npm-updater.ts` keeps the raw `OsvFixOutcome` param solely to serve the partial-revert success path (which must report OSV-only packages, not the merged list).

**FixerCallResult** — return value of any `FixerFn`. Fields: `breakingInstallError`, `packagesUpdated` (the final list the updater should report), optional `intermediateBackup` (post-OSV lockfile snapshot for test introspection), optional `partialRevert` (callable that restores to the intermediate state and re-bootstraps — built and returned by `osv-then-audit-fixer`; invoked strategy-agnostically by `npm-updater`).

**Native Deps** — OS-level system packages (e.g. `libvips-dev`, `libpq-dev`) declared under `runners.<id>.native_deps` in config. `resolveEcosystemRuntime` synthesizes an `apt-get install` preamble from the list and injects it into the run mode before passing the container to the ecosystem CLI. Ensures native npm/pip/composer addons that require system libraries can compile during `npm ci` / `pip install` / `composer install` inside ephemeral containers.

**Updater** — the function each plugin runs (`runNpmUpdater`, `runPipUpdater`, `runComposerUpdater`) that applies the fixer, runs validations, and reverts on failure. The shared revert/result-building skeleton lives in the **Updater Transaction** primitive.

**Updater Lifecycle** — `runUpdaterLifecycle<T>()` in `src/modules/ecosystem/utils/updater-lifecycle.ts`. Generic skeleton that owns the shared update sequence for all ecosystem updaters: probe → dry-run gate → `beginUpdaterTransaction` → `applyFix` → `preValidation` → `runValidations` → partial-revert loop → `tx.success` / `tx.abortWithError` → `PhaseError` wrap. Each updater provides an `UpdaterRecipe<TFixerResult>` — a plain object with typed hooks (`applyFix`, optional `probe`, `preValidation`, `derivePackagesUpdated`, `partialRevert`). The generic parameter `TFixerResult` flows the fixer result between hooks for type safety. `FixResult<T>` is a discriminated union (`{ ok:true; value:T } | { ok:false; error:string; validationStatus? }`). The partial-revert hook returns `{ packagesUpdated }` on success or `null` to skip partial revert; throwing propagates as `PhaseError('partial-revert-bootstrap')`. Lifecycle options (`RunLifecycleOpts`) carry `preFixBackups`, `preRunSnapshots`, and `failIfAllSkipped`.

**Updater Transaction** — `beginUpdaterTransaction()` in `src/modules/ecosystem/utils/updater-transaction.ts`. Encapsulates the full lifecycle of a dependency update: backup snapshot at begin, success path (`tx.success()`), and revert path (`tx.abortWithError()`). The revert is driven by a **BootstrapSpec** supplied by the calling Updater and follows the protocol: `restore → bootstrap → restore-byte-identical → warn-only dirty-tree check`. Bootstrap failure during revert always propagates (throws); the Updater's outer `try/catch` wraps it as `PhaseError`. A single `CommandRunner` is used for the entire lifecycle. The `osv-then-audit` partial-revert path is encapsulated in `FixerCallResult.partialRevert` — the fixer builds and returns the closure; the updater invokes it strategy-agnostically via the `partialRevert` recipe hook.

**BootstrapSpec** — opaque struct `{ binary, args, label }` each Updater passes to the Updater Transaction describing how to reinstall dependencies during revert. Examples: npm → `npm ci`; composer → `composer install --no-interaction --no-scripts [--ignore-platform-reqs]`; pip → `pip install -r requirements.txt`. The spec covers revert bootstrap only, not pre-flight environment checks.

**Ecosystem Environment Probe** — `runEcosystemEnvironmentProbe()` in `src/modules/ecosystem/utils/environment-probe.ts`. Verifies that an ecosystem CLI can run cleanly inside the active runner BEFORE any mutation. Driven by a `ProbeSpec { binary, args, cwd, errorPrefix, label }`. Returns a tagged `ProbeResult` — `{ ok:true }` on success, `{ ok:false, exitCode, detail, error }` on failure. Distinct from `BootstrapSpec` (which drives revert reinstall inside Updater Transaction). Today only `composer-updater` adopts it.

**OSV Fix Spec** — declarative struct on a plugin telling the orchestrator which lockfile `osv-scanner` can patch and which files to back up before patching.

**Post-Update OSV Verify** — policy on a plugin (`always` | `osv-strategy-only` | `never`) controlling residual vulnerability scanning after updates.

**Protected Package** — a package whose version is constrained by project policy. Constraint is a semver range. Vulnerabilities in protected packages whose `safeVersion` does not satisfy the constraint are classified `breaking: protected-constraint` and never installed automatically.

**Auto-Safe / Breaking / Manual** — classification of a vulnerable package's remediation path, computed by `classifyPackage()` in `src/core/policy/safe-update.ts`.

---

## Runtime

**Ecosystem Runtime Container** — the seam through which a plugin's CLI runs in an ephemeral Docker container. Owns image resolution, argv shaping, host vs container routing, retry on transient Docker errors, and streaming. Lives in `src/infrastructure/ecosystem-runtime/`.

**EcosystemRuntimeSpec** — declarative struct on a plugin describing how its CLI runs in a container: default image, image resolver, recognized binaries, run mode.

**Ephemeral Ecosystem Container** — implementation behind the runtime seam. One Docker `run --rm` per command, parameterized by an `EcosystemRuntimeSpec`.

**Run Mode** — tagged enum on the spec controlling how argv composes into `docker run`:
  - `direct-exec` — `docker run <image> <binary> <args...>` (no shell). Used by ecosystems whose CLI tolerates direct exec (npm).
  - `shell-wrap` — `docker run <image> sh -lc "<joined args>"` with optional image-conditional preamble. Used by ecosystems that need shell features or on-the-fly bootstrap (pip, composer).

**Run Mode Preamble** — optional function `(image) => string | undefined` carried by either run mode. Returns shell commands to inject before the main command, separated by `&&`. Used by composer to install composer on-the-fly on bare `php:*-cli` images (`shell-wrap`), and by `resolveEcosystemRuntime` to inject `apt-get install` for OS-level native deps when `native_deps` is configured (`direct-exec`). When both a plugin preamble and a `native_deps` preamble are present they are composed: native deps fire first so the plugin's bootstrap has its dependencies available.

**Host-Only Command** — `git`, `gh`, `open`. These never enter the ecosystem container and route to the host runner regardless of which ecosystem is active.

**Host Runner** — the `CommandRunner` (typically `LocalExecutor`) that handles host-only commands. Passed into the container command runner; replaces what the legacy code called `fallback`.

**Build Config** — optional `build` block on a runner (`ecosystems[].runner.build`) that selects how the ecosystem runner image is provisioned from a project-owned Dockerfile. When absent (default), the existing registry-image resolution chain is used (`pull`). When present, delegates to `buildProjectImage()` to build a stable local image. `image` and `build` may coexist — `build` is executed and the result is tagged with the value of `image`. Fields: `dockerfile`, `context`, `target`, `args`, `allow_context_escape`.

**Project Image Build** — `buildProjectImage()` in `src/infrastructure/ecosystem-runtime/build-project-image.ts`. Reads a project-owned Dockerfile, derives a stable local tag via SHA-256 of the combined `(dockerfile path, context, target, args)` tuple — not based on `logPrefix`. Multiple ecosystems sharing the same tuple get the same image tag (deduplication). Probes the local Docker daemon cache (`docker image inspect`) and only rebuilds when the tag is absent. Returns `{ image, entrypointOverride: "" }`. The `entrypointOverride` MUST be forwarded to `EphemeralEcosystemContainer` so `--entrypoint ""` is injected into every `docker run`, preventing the image's ENTRYPOINT from hijacking the ecosystem CLI binary. Emits a warning when the build context exceeds 50 MB. Build happens lazily on first use inside `resolveEcosystemRuntime` — the orchestrator is not modified.

---

## Scanner

**Scanner Engine** — implementation of `ScannerEngine` that produces a `ScanResultJson`. `OSV Scanner Engine` is primary; `SonarQube Engine` is secondary.

**Primary Engine** — the engine whose id matches `config.scanners.primary` (default `osv`). Drives Gate A. Failure is fatal.

**Secondary Engine** — any other registered engine. Failures honor `on_failure: 'warn' | 'fail'`.

**Residual Verification** — post-update OSV scan that checks whether vulnerabilities remain. Result is a tagged union: `verified` (all clean), `unverified` (CVEs remain), `skipped` (not run).

**Scanner Sweep** — `executeScannerSweep()` in `src/modules/scanner/scanner-sweep.ts`. Owns the multi-engine scan stage: runs each registered scanner engine via an injected renderer, classifies results into entries vs warnings, and applies the on_failure policy for secondary engines. Throws `PrimaryEngineFailure` when the primary engine fails. Config-agnostic — the on_failure resolver is injected as a callback by the orchestrator. Replaces the inlined `runAllEngines` loop that previously lived in `src/orchestration/orchestrator.ts`.

**Engine Run Renderer** — Adapter at the Scanner Sweep seam controlling visual presentation. Interface: `runSweep(engines, runOne) → Map<engineId, Result | Error>`. Two implementations: `listr2ScannerSweepRenderer(rendererType)` builds a single Listr2 task list, sets the global progressSink to each task's output, and swallows the bundled ListrError (errors are reported per-engine via the Map). `silentScannerSweepRenderer` runs engines sequentially with no UI — used by tests and JSON-output mode.

**PrimaryEngineFailure** — typed exception thrown by Scanner Sweep when the primary engine (id === `config.scanners.primary`) either throws or returns `status='error'`. Carries `{ engineId, cause, partialWarnings }`. `partialWarnings` preserves warnings already accumulated from secondary engines that ran before the primary failed — kept so the orchestrator can include them in error diagnostics rather than discard already-paid work.

---

## Reporting

**Executive Report** — HTML summary saved per run, generated via the reporting template engine. Driven by `OrchestratorResult` + post-fix scan. Internationalized via `i18n/` (en, pt-br).

**Audit Trail** — JSON record of each run (timestamp, CLI version, dry-run flag, scan, updates, status). Written by `writeAuditTrail()`.

**Cloud Storage** — optional Google Drive upload of generated reports. Local file is always written; Drive upload is additive.

---

## Config & Workflow

**Project Config** — `security-scan.config.json`. Loaded and validated by `src/infrastructure/config/loader.ts`.

**Config Version** — `config_version: '1'`. Future incompatible schema changes bump this.

**Runners Config** — per-ecosystem Docker runner settings declared inline as `ecosystems[].runner` in the project config. Separated from `scanners` (which retains OSV and SonarQube engine config). Each runner entry carries `language_version`, `native_deps`, and an optional `build` block with shape `{ dockerfile?, context?, target?, args?, allow_context_escape? }`. Multiple ecosystems sharing the same `build` tuple (dockerfile + context + target + args) receive the same image tag automatically (image deduplication). Loader emits a migration error if the old `scanners.npm/pip/composer` keys are detected.

**Language Version** — field `ecosystems[].runner.language_version` (renamed from `runtime_version`). Version hint used by the ephemeral image resolver to select the appropriate Node/Python/PHP base image (e.g. `"20"`, `"3.11"`, `"8.2"`). Canonical runtime hint for npm container execution; also used by pip and composer resolvers.

**Kill Switch** — `SECURITY_SCAN_NO_AUTO_FIX` env var. When set, the orchestrator runs the scan but skips all automated fixes and writes no files.

**Git/PR Workflow** — `--create-branch` + optional `--open-pr` orchestrate a branch creation, fix run, commit, push, and `gh pr create`. Lives in `src/infrastructure/utils/git-commit.ts`.
