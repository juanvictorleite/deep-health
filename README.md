# security-scan

One command that scans for vulnerabilities, applies safe dependency updates, runs your tests to confirm nothing broke, reverts if it did, and generates an executive report — all inside isolated Docker containers, with no local tool installation required beyond Docker itself.

Supports PHP (Composer), Node.js (npm), and Python (pip). Powered by [OSV Scanner](https://google.github.io/osv-scanner/) under the hood.

## Why this exists

Every month, I had to do the same thing for every client project:

1. Run OSV Scanner manually against each lockfile
2. Figure out which packages were safe to update without breaking anything
3. Apply the updates, run the test suite, revert if it broke
4. Generate three separate reports

It took hours. It was boring. And because it was boring, it sometimes didn't happen.

So I built `security-scan` to do all of it in one command.

Now it runs in CI, opens a PR with safe fixes already validated against the test suite, and delivers the executive report automatically. What used to take an afternoon takes about 15 minutes — most of which is waiting for tests to run.

The tool exists because the problem was real, the existing solutions (Dependabot, Renovate, Snyk) either didn't cover PHP/Composer reliably enough or didn't give me the end-to-end pipeline I needed: scan → fix in an isolated container → validate → revert if broken → report → PR. I needed all of those steps to be automatic and safe. None of the tools I tried did that out of the box.

## How it works

1. **Scan** — runs OSV Scanner against your `composer.lock`, `package-lock.json`, and `requirements.txt` / `Pipfile.lock`
2. **Fix** — applies patch/minor updates that don't break declared constraints; skips protected packages
3. **Report** — generates an HTML executive report with a vulnerability summary

Breaking changes (constraint bumps, major versions) are never applied automatically. They require explicit per-package authorization via `--authorize-breaking`.

---

## Requirements

| Tool | Version | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| Node.js | ≥ 26.0.0 | Required. Use `nvm use` to activate the correct version (`.nvmrc` included). |
| Docker | any recent version | Required for all scan and fix operations. |

Docker is used to run OSV Scanner (and optionally SonarQube) in ephemeral containers. No local installation of those tools is needed.

---

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g security-scan
```

Or run without installing:

```bash
npx security-scan --help
```

---

## Quick start

**1. Generate a config file**

```bash
security-scan init
```

This creates a `project-config.yml` in the current directory with sane defaults based on your runtime environment.

**2. Scan for vulnerabilities**

```bash
security-scan scan
```

**3. Scan and apply safe updates**

```bash
security-scan fix
```

That's it. Results are printed to stdout. Pass `--output report.html` to save the report to a file.

---

## Commands

### `init`

Generate a `project-config.yml` template.

```bash
security-scan init [options]

Options:
  --project-name <name>   Project name
  --client <name>         Client name
  --output <path>         Output path (default: ./project-config.yml)
  --force                 Overwrite existing file
```

### `scan`

Run the vulnerability scan only (no updates applied).

```bash
security-scan scan [options]

Options:
  -c, --config <path>     Path to project-config.yml (default: ./project-config.yml)
  --cwd <path>            Working directory (default: current directory)
  --dry-run               Show commands without executing
  -v, --verbose           Verbose output
  -q, --quiet             Suppress all output except errors and final report
  --json                  Output results as JSON
  -o, --output <path>     Write report to file
```

### `fix`

Full workflow: scan → apply safe updates → generate executive report.

```bash
security-scan fix [options]

Options:
  -c, --config <path>             Path to project-config.yml
  --phases <phases>               Comma-separated phases: scan,npm,composer,pip,report
                                  (default: "scan,npm,composer,pip")
  --no-report                     Skip executive report generation
  --authorize-breaking <id...>    Authorize breaking-change updates for the given
                                  ecosystem(s). Example: --authorize-breaking composer npm pip
  --dry-run                       Show commands without executing
  -v, --verbose                   Verbose output
  --json                          Output results as JSON
  -o, --output <path>             Write report to file
  --create-branch                 Create a git branch before applying fixes, commit on success
  --branch-prefix <prefix>        Branch name prefix (default: fix/security-scan-)
  --open-pr                       Open a GitHub PR after fix (implies --create-branch; requires gh CLI)
  --pr-title <title>              Pull request title (default: auto-generated)
```

### `executive-report`

Generate an executive HTML report from the last scan results.

```bash
security-scan executive-report [options]

Options:
  --client <name>     Client name (overrides project-config.yml)
  --project <name>    Project name (overrides project-config.yml)
  -o, --output <path> Write report to file
```

### `cloud-setup`

Interactive Google Drive folder picker — saves the selected folder ID to `project-config.yml` for automatic report distribution.

```bash
security-scan cloud-setup
```

---

## Configuration

`security-scan init` generates a starter `project-config.yml`. Here is a full annotated example:

```yaml
config_version: '1'

project:
  name: 'My Project'
  client: 'Acme Corp'

ecosystems:
  - id: 'npm'
    fixer: 'osv'                    # osv | npm-audit | osv-then-audit
    validationCommands:
      - name: 'tests'
        command: 'npm test'
        timeout_seconds: 120        # optional, default: 300 (5 min)
    advisors:
      - name: 'audit'
        command: 'npm audit --json'
        format: 'json'
  - id: 'composer'
    fixer: 'osv'
    validationCommands:
      - name: 'tests'
        command: 'php artisan test'

# Packages that must never be updated beyond their stated constraint.
# Any update requiring a constraint change needs explicit --authorize-breaking.
protected_packages:
  npm:
    - package: 'tailwindcss'
      constraint: '^3.3.3'
      reason: 'Tailwind v4 has breaking config and migration requirements'
  composer:
    - package: 'laravel/framework'
      constraint: '^10.8'
      reason: 'Major upgrade to Laravel 11 requires a dedicated project'

safe_update_policy:
  # Patch and minor updates within current constraints are applied automatically
  # when tests pass.
  allow_patch_and_minor_within_constraints: true
  # Constraint changes always require explicit human authorization.
  require_authorization_for_constraint_change: true

conflict_resolution: 'manual'

# Optional: configure scanner engines
scanners:
  primary: 'osv'          # engine id to use as Gate A source (default: 'osv')
  osv:
    runner: 'docker'      # docker | local | auto
  sonarqube:
    enabled: false        # set true to enable SonarQube integration

# Optional: per-ecosystem Docker runner configuration
runners:
  npm:
    language_version: '20' # override Node version for Docker image
  composer:
    language_version: '8.2'
  pip:
    language_version: '3.11'

# Optional: report output
outputs:
  formats: ['markdown']
  dir: 'reports'

# Optional: Google Drive report distribution
cloud_storage:
  provider: 'google_drive'
  folder_id: 'YOUR_FOLDER_ID'
  require_upload: false   # set true to fail CI when upload fails
```

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `0` | Clean — no vulnerabilities or all resolved |
| `1` | Vulnerabilities found / update errors |
| `2` | Gate validation failure or scanner error |
| `3` | Configuration error |

These codes make `security-scan` suitable for use in CI/CD pipelines.

---

## Git/PR Workflow

By default, `security-scan fix` mutates the working tree directly. Use `--create-branch` to wrap the fix in a reviewable Git branch:

```bash
# Create a branch, apply fixes, commit on success
security-scan fix --create-branch

# Create a branch AND open a GitHub PR (requires gh auth login)
security-scan fix --open-pr

# Custom branch prefix
security-scan fix --create-branch --branch-prefix deps/security-fix-
```

**Branch lifecycle:**
- Branch is created BEFORE any mutation: `fix/security-scan-<ISO-timestamp>`
- On success: changes are staged and committed as `fix: apply safe dependency updates [security-scan]`
- On failure: original branch is restored; no commit is made

**`--open-pr` prerequisites:** [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) installed and authenticated (`gh auth login`). The PR body includes ecosystem summary and security-scan version attribution.

## Security

### SEC-004 — Validation command execution

`validationCommands` and advisor commands from `project-config.yml` are now executed **inside the ecosystem's Docker container** (node, php, python) via `sh -c`, not on the host. This means:

- `jest --coverage`, `php artisan test`, `pytest` — run inside the project's pinned runtime container
- Only commands starting with `git`, `gh`, or `open` are exempted and run on the host

**Trust boundary:** these strings are authored by the repository owner (same person who checks in `project-config.yml`), not by external sources. Variable data (package names, versions, CVE ids) is never interpolated into validation command strings.

**OAuth browser opener** (`cloud-setup`): the Google OAuth URL is opened via `execFile` with `shell: false`, passing the URL as a discrete `argv` element. Shell metacharacters in the URL cannot cause command injection because no shell is involved in the spawn.

> If you use `security-scan` in a context where `project-config.yml` is written by untrusted parties, treat those command strings as untrusted input and review them before running the tool.
